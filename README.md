## Project Description: 
During the course of this project, we explored methods of making data visualizations more accessible to those with visual impairments. While descriptions can be written by visualization creators (and then a text to speech app could be used to hear the description), we believe that this method may not always portray the data accurately due to the lack of details that can be transmitted in this way.

After an ideation process, generating multiple, distinct prototypes, we completed a participatory design process, interviewing people with a variety of visual impairments regarding their needs and desires surrounding accessible data visualizaiton. We ultimately implemented v_a11y_lint, a lint software to flag issues regarding accessibility in Altair-created data visualizations.
