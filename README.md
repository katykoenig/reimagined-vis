## Topic Description: 
During the course of this project, we will explore translating data visualizations into modes that can be accurately consumed by people with visual impairments. While descriptions can be written by visualization creators (and then a text to speech app could be used to hear the description), we believe that this method may not always portray the data accurately due to the lack of details that can be transmitted in this way. Instead, we seek to explore different routes to depict visualizations such as sonification, 3-D designs, etc. and create an app in which visualization designers can input their code with the output being a consumable for someone with a visual disability. Additionally, while we hope to create an app tailored to people with a wide variety of visual impairments, we understand that due to the constraints of the quarter, this may not be feasible. Therefore, at a minimum, we plan to survey and implement a design that can cater to people who experience color blindness.

Note: you will find all future deliverables for this project in this repo.
