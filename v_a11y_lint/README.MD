## TODO

### Linting Features to Add (Coding)
### Focus right now: bar charts \& histograms

*  Check for readable font (font size already done)
*  Check for title/descriptive title (min length)
*  Check bar chart spacing (is there white space between bars?)
*  Check that opacity/alpha is not too low
*  For color maps, add function to check for vector space (cosine) distance (not contrast like text) <-- Katy
*  Write code to check only relevant parts of config, e.g. if doing a histogram, we don't need to check color maps (right now, we are checking the global/theme configs instead of the chart specific ones in some parts)
*  Check for direct labels instead of labels only located in keys
*  Check "fill" for marks to ensure enough contrast between background color
*  Write tests for our functions
*  Create jupyter notebook for Friday's in class prototype presentation

### Non-coding Specific

*  MOST IMPORTANT: Figure out default theme/config in Altair
*  Research re. best font practices (serifed vs. sans serifed, what should we do w/ font weight?)
*  File altair issue as patterns encoding not supported
*  Figure out use of "description" attribute, i.e. chart.discription --> is this accessible on JAWS? If yes, add as feature to lint
